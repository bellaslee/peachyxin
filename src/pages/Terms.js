        <h2>3. delivery</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds).</li>
          <li>While I'm working on your commission, I will periodically check in with you to make sure all the details are correct.</li>
          <li>The amount of check-ins depends on the complexity of the work.</li>
          <li>During the check-in, you will see a work-in-progress, and these images will usually be smaller than the finished piece.</li>
          <li>The time it takes to finish your commission varies from 3 weeks to 2 months based on health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, university deadlines, and other work.</li>
          <li>If anything comes up that will slow the progress, I will let you know as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>Once the piece is finished, you will receive the full-resolution image. Note that there is no physical product.</li>

          <li>A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing unless there has been a misunderstanding on my end.</li>
          <li>If you wish for me to change something in the drawing that you already approved in a previous check-in, there will be an extra fee. The fee depends on the change you want me to make and it is usually based on an hourly wage.</li>
          <li>If your reference is unclear to start with, changes will come at an extra charge.</li>

        <h2>5. copyright and usage</h2>
        <p>
          I, Bella Lee "peachyxin" (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:
          <ul>
            <li>Promote myself with it anywhere</li>
            <li>Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)</li>
            <li>Post it wherever I want</li>
            <li>I reserve the full rights to the image and its use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The buyer is allowed to:
          <ul>
            <li>Retain the intellectual property of any original characters featured in the piece</li>
            <li>Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)</li>
            <li>Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself</li>
            <li>Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated</li>
            <li>Use the artwork on their Youtube channel, Twitch page, and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings</li>
            <li>The following is considered copyright infringement:
              <ul>
                <li>Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially (i.e. profit directly off of my work) unless otherwise discussed</li>
                <li>Claiming the artwork as your own</li>
                <li>Removing my signature from the artwork</li>
                <li>Altering the artwork without my consent</li>

        <h2>6. customer satisfaction</h2>

          <li>I will do everything I can to make my customers happy.</li>
          <li>If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece, please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</li>
          <li>I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. For example, if you do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</li>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>7. refunds and cancellation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</li>
          <li>If for any reason I am unable to start or complete your commission, you will receive a full refund.</li>
          <li>If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</li>
          <li>If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.</li>
          <li>If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you are no longer allowed to receive a refund, you will lose all the beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece, and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talked about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted from commissioning me again.</li>
          <li>If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Bella Lee "peachyxin" (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.</li>
