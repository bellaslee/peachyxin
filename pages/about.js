        <p>
          Hi, I'm Bella, and I'm a uni student and illustrator based in Seattle. I'm currently studying web development, but art still remains one of my greatest passions. Smooth animation and yummy colors never fail to inspire me. Right now, the greatist influences on my art are Araki Hirohiko, J. C. Leyendecker, Marco Bucci, and 02png. My dream has always been to inspire other people to pursue their passions, so I'm very happy that I've been able to do that with my growing audience on Instagram. When I am not drawing, you'll find me playing guitar, singing, or learning a new coding language!
